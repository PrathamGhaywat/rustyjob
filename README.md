![RustyJob banner](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/dde9bf34bfd66da9_rustyjob_banner.png)
RustyJob is a lightweight local-first distributed task scheduler written in Rust. It allows you to schedule and manage tasks across you single maschine or multiple maschines in a local network or even over the interner.

## Features
- Local-first design: Designed to work primarily on one maschine, for small or personal tasks.
- Tiny footprint: Shouldn't hog your system resources
- Easy to use: CLI with optional web interface for managing tasks

## Installation
To install RustyJob, please have a look at the releases tab and download the appropriate binary for your OS. Currently it only supports Windows(x86_64). For other OSes, you need to build it from source.
